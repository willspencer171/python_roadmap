# Roadmap - Python

## This repo is set up to follow my progress as I learn Python from the ground up. I have a little history with Python, but only at a very surface level so I'm documenting my learning as I go

### I'm using this [Python Roadmap](roadmap.sh/python) as a guide, starting with data structures and continuing from there.
