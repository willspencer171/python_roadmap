'''
Time complexity of Merge sort:
The merge sort is rooted in recursion and thus, divide and conquer.

It splits the list in two, sorts each list, then merges the lists together

through recursion

This means it creates lists upon lists until each list cannot be divided by two
Then it sorts the pairs, and merges upwards

The time complexity for this is:
merge() has time complexity O(n) as it will look at each element no more than once
merge_sort() has time complexity O(log n) as this is the total number of halving operations

O(n) * O(log n) = O(n log n) which is the fastest possible for a sorting algorithm
