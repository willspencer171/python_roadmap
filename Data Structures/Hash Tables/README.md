# Hash Tables

## Dipping my toes into Test-Driven Development (TDD) as well as messing around with different data types

---
Following a link from [Roadmap - Python](roadmap.sh/python), I came across Real Python's [Build a Hash Table in Python with TDD](https://realpython.com/python-hash-table/). For most of this leg of my development, I used this as my bible, a holy text, the final remaining pillar of my sanity.

I think it took me 3, maybe 4, days on and off to get through this mammoth webpage, much like the [Heaps, Stacks and Queues](https://realpython.com/queue-in-python) tutorial.

> This was a great learning experience for me in that I've found some expert best practices for testing, as well as creating object classes
>
> - Test-Driven Development (see [test](https://github.com/willspencer171/python_roadmap/tree/master/Data%20Structures/Hash%20Tables/test_hashtable.py))
>   - This kind of gives me a good way to document my steps in creating code, rather than just creating and not having any evidence for the ridiculous number of adjustments and tests actually done
> - Bespoke object classes (HashTable and Pair are examples)
>   - The HashTable object is different from the tutorial in that I have refactored the separate chaining implementation into the main HashTable class, so that it is an option of that class, rather than a separate, nearly identical class
>   - I'm fairly convinced it looks horrible, even with pattern matching (match case), so any better ideas on implementation would be **HUGELY** appreciated
> - Python special / dunder methods
>   - Very cool to be able to finally know what's going on with these and how they can be useful for me in practice
