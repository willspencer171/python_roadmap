# Binary Search Trees
## A lovely re-introduction to recursive functions that made it very difficult for me to wrap my head around
---
I started on [this website](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/implementing-binary-search-tree-using-python/) and found that it was lacking in explanation for absolutely anything, but I still followed along with it to see what it would provide for me. Not a right lot.

So I then went back to my trusty [Real Python](realpython.com) but they didn't have any tutorials or the likes regarding Binary Search Trees? After a bit of searching around, I found [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search-tree-data-structure/)'s site that has some pretty good implementation in all sorts of languages. 

However, I wanted all the functions to be called on the class itself, rather than being outside of the class. This led to a lot of complications but I eventually managed to figure out a few bits and pieces. Especially in the case of traversals of a tree, I had to use some information that I read somewhere very briefly and it really helped.

This was `yield` and `yield from` by the way.

> Having got to the end of it, I now understand better:
>- Recursion
>- How Python garbage collection works
>- Why objects can't self-referentially delete themselves with `del`
>- How time and space complexities are affected by using recursion

Next course of action is to tackle the tasks set out [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search-tree-data-structure/) cos some of these are absolutely insane and would make a really good progression from my own work that I've done here. Will potentially be updating in the future
